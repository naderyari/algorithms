# Intuition
The problem requires removing subfolders from a list of folder paths. The simplest way to identify subfolders is to check if one path starts with another parent path. By sorting the folders lexicographically, subfolders will always appear immediately after their corresponding parent folders, which makes it easy to filter them out with a single pass through the list.

# Approach
Sort the Folders: First, we sort the list of folders lexicographically. This ensures that any subfolder will appear directly after its parent folder in the list.
Filter Subfolders: We initialize an empty result array. Then, we iterate over the sorted list and add each folder to the result if it does not start with the most recent folder in the result (plus a trailing /). This way, we can filter out any subfolder by simple string comparison.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
Sorting the folders takes 𝑂 ( 𝑛 log ⁡ 𝑛 ) O(nlogn), where 𝑛 n is the number of folders. The subsequent pass through the list to filter out subfolders is 𝑂 ( 𝑛 ) O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is 𝑂 ( 𝑛 log ⁡ 𝑛 ) O(nlogn). 
- Space complexity:
 𝑂 ( 𝑛 ) O(n), as we store the filtered folders in a separate result array.

# Code
```php []
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param String[] $folder
     * @return String[]
     */
    function removeSubfolders($folder) {
        sort($folder);
        $result = [];

    foreach ($folder as $f) {
        if (empty($result) || strpos($f, end($result) . '/') !== 0) {
            $result[] = $f;
        }
    }
    
    return $result;
    }
}
```
