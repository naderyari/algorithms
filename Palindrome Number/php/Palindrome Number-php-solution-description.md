# Intuition
The initial thought to solve this problem is to convert the integer into a string. This allows us to leverage string manipulation functions to easily reverse the string and compare it to the original. By comparing the original and reversed strings, we can determine if the number is a palindrome.

# Approach
Convert to String: The integer is converted to a string using the strval() function in PHP.
Reverse String: The string is reversed using the strrev() function.
Compare Strings: The original string and the reversed string are compared. If they are equal, the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log n)
Converting an integer to a string and reversing a string typically takes logarithmic time in terms of the number of digits in the integer.
- Space complexity: O(log n)
The space required to store the string representation of the integer is proportional to the number of digits, which is logarithmic in terms of the integer's value.
# Code
```php []
class Solution {

    /**
     * @param Integer $x
     * @return Boolean
     */
    function isPalindrome($x) {
        if (strval($x)== strrev($x)){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
